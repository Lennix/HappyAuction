- fix haListSelect failing if called twice in a row
- add haListItemStat(stat) to quickly get current item stat value by name: see readme
- add current bid to haListItem(): see readme.
- make the haSettingsListDelay() delay a factor in all operations not just reading list items. this should help those with cpu lag/low FPS reduces errors better. next update ill try to make this unncessary by throttling against FPS directly.


- add readme warning to always check function status
