- FIX: haFilterUnique screwing up on longer names
- FIX: haSellIterate() reading incorrect item data when scrolling past the 5th item
- FIX: haSetGlobalDelay() will now be specific to the multiclient session instead of a shared setting between all sessions
- FIX: haSell() sometimes returning success when an error occurred (such as 10 auction limit reached message)
- FIX: haItem().rarity on several different locales and a few EN cases (rarity now derived from tooltip text color instead of text)
- FIX: haSetLoginDelay() being reset to 0 when calling haSetLogin()
- POSSIBLE FIX: stalling on "Input Limit Reached" error. I couldn't reproduce this but made a tiny change that may fix it :)
- UPDATE: haBid(), haBuyout(), haSell(): additional error checks especially to haBid. should now only return true if actually successful in buying/selling item. this also fixes error message stalling issues.
- UPDATE: reworked training to eliminate all but 1 memory scan thus greatly eliminating that lag during initial startup and and relogin.
